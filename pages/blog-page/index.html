        <p>
            As a freshman in college, I faced a tough decision: pursue a major that aligns with my career goals or follow my passion. 
            I took a chance and enrolled in a web design and development program, despite having no prior experience. 
            As I've started to learn more, I've discovered a passion that's exceeded my expectations. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript under my belt,
             I've been able to dive deeper into the creative aspects of web design. My goal is to craft websites that bring a smile to people's faces -
              not just because they're functional, but because they're visually stunning and a joy to interact with. I believe that a beautifully designed
               website can evoke emotions and create a sense of wonder. I'm excited to continue honing my skills in user experience (UX) design, typography,
                and color theory to create websites that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also intuitive and engaging. 
            My dream is to design a website that people will love using, one that will brighten their day and leave a lasting impression.
